### Day 3 7/10/18

**Today's Progress**: CodeCademy and Odin Project lesson, experimented a little with nested loops on my own, did some anki and freecodecamp

### Day 4 8/10/18

**Today's Progress**: CodeCademy and Odin Project lesson, had some fun with functions on my own, completed anki deck

### Day 5 9/10/18

**Today's Progress**: CodeCademy and anki deck, about halfway through rock paper scissors project

**Thoughts** I learned about .reduce(), .findIndex(), .filter(), .map(), .forEach(), and .some(). I felt very mentally stuck with the project and felt it was best to take a break after the hour was finished rather than push through.

### Day 6 10/10/18

**Today's Progress**: Finished rock paper scissors project

**Thoughts** Wow it felt so good to see that thing run in the console! I feel so excited, but I know that this is really a very basic project and I need practice a lot more until I can do these things easily
