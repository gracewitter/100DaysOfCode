### Day 2 6/10/18

**Today's Progress**: 2 CodeCademy lessons, Applied Visual Design on freecodecamp, lesson 2 in TOP, sales receipt program from Duckett book, anki deck

**Thoughts**: Very happy with all i did today. I had a few moments that i found very confusing but worked through them without needing the solution, especially happy with the sales receipt program

### Day 3 7/10/18

**Today's Progress**: CodeCademy and Odin Project lesson, experimented a little with nested loops on my own, did some anki and freecodecamp

**Thoughts** I was so so tired tonight, so I'm proud of myself for even doing this even though I might not have finished all that i would've liked

### Day 4 8/10/18

**Today's Progress**: CodeCademy and Odin Project lesson, had some fun with functions on my own, completed anki deck

**Thoughts** Once again I was very very tired but pushed through. Now I feel so excited and energised from figuring out higher level functions and getting them to work

### Day 5 9/10/18

**Today's Progress**: CodeCademy and anki deck, about halfway through rock paper scissors project

**Thoughts** I learned about .reduce(), .findIndex(), .filter(), .map(), .forEach(), and .some(). I felt very mentally stuck with the project and felt it was best to take a break after the hour was finished rather than push through.
